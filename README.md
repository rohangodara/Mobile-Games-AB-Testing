# Mobile-Games-AB-Testing
Cookie Cats is a hugely popular mobile puzzle game developed by Tactile Entertainment. It's a classic "connect three" style puzzle game where the player must connect tiles of the same color in order to clear the board and win the level. It also features singing cats.

As players progress through the game they will encounter gates that force them to wait some time before they can progress or make an in-app purchase. In this project, I analyze the result of an A/B test where the first gate in Cookie Cats was moved from level 30 to level 40. In particular, I analyze the impact on player retention.

## Motivation
In 2021, the global video game industry was estimated to generate revenues of over $150 billion. While mobile games lag behind console and PC games in development costs, they make up around 51% of all video game revenues. <sup>[1]</sup>

Ever since my father allowed me to play Spider-Man 2 on PS2 back in 2006, I have been an avid gamer.
